SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

In our project file, there are 2 main folders named client and api. We handle the frontend part in the client folder and the backend part in the api folder. Inside our Api folder, we have folders named 2 main “controllers” and “routes”. While the codes of our database queries are in the controllers, the "http" routes of these functions are kept in our routes folder. There are 4 main folders in our client folder: src, components, pages, styles. In our Components folder, we create our components such as Navbar, Card, Carousel. In the Pages section, we keep our main pages such as Movie, Watchlist, Favorites, Account, Description, Admin, Login, Register. We have css files in the Styles folder. We also have our main App.js file in our src folder.
